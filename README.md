# Study Buddy

## What is Study Buddy?
Study buddy is a assistant meant for students to achieve higher marks and reach deadline easier. With a simple UI(I promise Ill do some html/css stuff in a bit) it is very intuitive for any student(ES, MS, HS, College, Uni) to use. I myself am a student and made this based on my own experience in having trouble meeting deadlines.

## Features:
* **Create a task**
* **Edit Task**
* **View all tasks**
* **View Individual Tasks**

### Create a task:
Very simple creation by using a JSON template I made

### Edit task:
Opens up a existing task and simple find and replace

### View all tasks
Provides a general overview of all tasks needed to be completed

### View individual tasks
Allows you to see things like deadlines, flash cards, priority, etc.

## Future Upgrade:
* **HTML/CSS UI**
* **Reminders about deadline through live time checking**
* **LLM assistant for simplicity and help**
