# Study Buddy

## What is Study Buddy?
Study buddy is a assistant meant for students to achieve higher marks and reach deadline easier. With a simple UI(I promise Ill do some html/css stuff in a bit) it is very intuitive for any student(ES, MS, HS, College, Uni) to use. I myself am a student and made this based on my own experience in having trouble meeting deadlines.

## Features:
* **Create a task**
* **Edit Task**
* **View all tasks**
* **View Individual Tasks**

### Create a task:
Very simple creation by using a JSON template I made

### Edit task:
Opens up a existing task and simple find and replace

### View all tasks
Provides a general overview of all tasks needed to be completed

### View individual tasks
Allows you to see things like deadlines, flash cards, priority, etc.

## Future Upgrade:

### Milestone 1: fix absolute basic things
**Easier navigation through tasks (avoid typing task titles). Use task IDs not task titles etc**
**Better display of the entire JSON fields** //Completed
**Study mode w/ flashcards** //Completed

### Milestone 2: I use this everyday
**A Browser UI so that I run this easily**
**Reminders about deadline**

### Milestone 3: another person uses this everyday
**task 1**
**task 2**

## How to run
Good news, There are no requrements. Just import main.py into you prefered IDE and type into terminal:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
As long as you have a version of python with datetime installed as a library(and of course internet) It works!
